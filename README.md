Predicting patients' heart disease condition 


Originally, the dataset come from the CDC and is a major part of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of U.S. residents. 
As the CDC describes: "Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, 
making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world."

The original dataset of nearly 300 variables was reduced to just about 20 variables.
The dataset is available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kamilpytlak/personal-key-indicators-of-heart-disease

The objective of this project is to find a model that predicts patients' heart disease conditino.
